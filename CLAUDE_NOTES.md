## Dashboard — `dashboard/`

Standalone Next.js 15 app under `dashboard/`. Reads `dashboard/public/results.json`
written by the bot on every candle close. Start with `npm run dev` inside `dashboard/`.

### Stack
- Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind v4 (CSS-based config, no `tailwind.config.ts`)
- Chart.js + react-chartjs-2 + chartjs-adapter-date-fns (`type: 'time'` scale)

### Components
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `app/page.tsx` | Main page — data load, level filter state, date range state, derived filtered datasets |
| `components/Header.tsx` | Symbol, timeframe, mode badge, current price, snapshot timestamp |
| `components/LevelFilter.tsx` | L1/L2/L3 segmented button control (ceiling filter) |
| `components/SwingPointsChart.tsx` | Price chart with 4 lines + swing dots + amber trend line |
| `components/TrendLevelsTable.tsx` | Trend level summary (direction, BoS, last high/low) |
| `components/AllPointsTable.tsx` | Two-column sortable table — active points only |
| `components/SignalsPanel.tsx` | Active trading signals |
| `lib/types.ts` | TypeScript interfaces for all JSON fields |

### Chart datasets
1. **Close Price** — indigo filled line
2. **Open Price** — slate dashed line
3. **Max Price** — green dashed line (kline highs)
4. **Min Price** — red dashed line (kline lows)
5. **Trend Line** — amber, connects active swing points only (straight segments)
6. **Swing Points** — colored dots per level × high/low; click legend to toggle any series

All price lines are clamped to start at the **earliest active** swing point visible on the chart.

### Point display rules
- `active: true` — full-color dot (L1 green/red, L2 amber/orange, L3 violet/sky); radius 5/7/9
- `active: false` — small gray mark (radius 3, 35% opacity) — historical context only
- **Tables** show only active points
- Inactive points that predate the oldest active point in the current filter are removed entirely

### Filtering (toolbar — one row)
- **Level selector** (L1/L2/L3): ceiling — L2 shows L1+L2 points and trend levels
- **From / To** datetime-local pickers: filter both klines and points by date range
- **Clear** button: resets both date pickers

---

## Decisions made

### Architecture
- Folder structure: `bot/`, `config/`, `data/`, `logs/`, `tests/`, `dashboard/`
- Dashboard is a separate Next.js app, not coupled to bot runtime
- Bot and dashboard communicate only via `dashboard/public/results.json`

### Strategy
- Price Action: swing highs/lows detected via `SWING_NEIGHBOURS` rule (default 3)
- Multi-level `Trend` hierarchy — L1 finest, L3 coarsest
- `removePointsUpTo()` is called on every BoS crossing, wiping older points from the live trend

### Permanent swing point history (added 2026-04-21)
Problem: `removePointsUpTo()` left only 1 point in exports after a BoS event.
Solution: `Analyzer` maintains `_all_points` — a list that accumulates every detected point with level assignments, captured **before** any BoS wipeout can occur:
- L1 points captured at detection time (before `checkPointObject`)
- L2/L3 points captured via `_capture_bigger_trends()` after each `checkPointObject`
- `get_all_points()` computes `active` flag by comparing to current live trend state
- Exporter uses this history; fallback to live-trend traversal if not provided

### Active / inactive point distinction
- Active = currently present in the live trend (post-BoS state)
- Inactive = historically detected but wiped by a subsequent BoS
- Both exported; dashboard uses `active` flag to style differently
- Tables filter to active only; chart shows both

### Exporter
- `_MAX_KLINES = 1000` — exports full kline cache (≈10 days at 15m) so price lines reach oldest active point
- Exports on startup and every candle close

### Data
- Kline cache: `data/{SYMBOL}_{TIMEFRAME}.json`, up to 1000 candles, gitignored
- On startup: load cache → fetch only missing since last cached → merge → save

### WebSocket
- `{symbol}@kline_{timeframe}` stream; reconnect with exponential backoff
- `on_candle_close` fires on `k.x == true`

### Config
- `.env`: `SYMBOL`, `TIMEFRAME`, `KLINE_LIMIT`, `SWING_NEIGHBOURS`, `TRADING_MODE`, `TIMEZONE`
- Live mode requires `LIVE_MODE_CONFIRMED=yes` as second guard

## Known issues / notes
- **Testnet price spikes**: Testnet produces artificial prices (e.g. 83,000 when real BTC ~75,000). These form valid-looking L2 swing points in history. Dashboard shows them accurately.
- **Multiple bot instances**: Two concurrent `python main.py` processes race to write `results.json` and the kline cache. Always kill old process before starting new one.
- **Cache corruption**: If a bot instance is killed mid-write, the cache JSON can truncate. Next run logs "No cache found" and re-fetches 1000 klines from testnet automatically.

---

## Rejected alternatives
- Polling price — rejected for WebSocket (exact candle-close events)
- Database for kline storage — deferred, JSON cache sufficient
- python-binance WebSocket manager — rejected for direct `websockets` (explicit testnet/live URL)
- Traversing live trend for `all_points` export — rejected; BoS wipeouts cause single-point exports
- Showing only active points on chart — rejected; inactive shown as gray context marks

---

## Open questions
- `Recommendation` / order placement logic — placeholder only, not built
- MySQL credentials in `.env` — not needed for bot, ignored

---

## .env current state
- `TRADING_MODE=testnet` ✓
- `TESTNET_API_KEY` / `TESTNET_API_SECRET` present ✓
- `SYMBOL=BTCUSDT`, `TIMEZONE=Europe/Kyiv` ✓
- Live `API_KEY` / `API_SECRET` also present — keep separate from testnet usage

---

## Next steps
1. **Dashboard auto-refresh** — poll `results.json` every N seconds so the page updates without manual reload
2. **Account info panel** — balance, available margin, unrealised PnL via Binance Futures REST
3. **Strategy validation** — run on testnet, review signal quality from `logs/trades.log`
4. **Risk management module** — position sizing, daily loss limit, leverage check on startup
5. **Order placement** — design entry/exit logic from `Recommendation`; requires risk module first
